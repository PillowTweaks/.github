> "worth of the moon"

*The Moon's most valuable part is Helium-3, which can power nuclear fusion reactors, estimated to be worth $640,000 per pound, or around $25 quadrillion if every last ounce could be mined. However, the Moon is not as rich in valuable metals as asteroids, and it would require mining about 1,300 tons of rock to collect one troy ounce. The cost of sending humans to the Moon was Â£20.3 ($25.4billion) at the time, but the value in terms of human progress was immense. The Apollo program cost about $177 billion in 2019 dollars and required a decade of work from more than 400,000 Americans. Even with 50 years' hindsight, we may not yet fully realize the moonshot's true worth.*
